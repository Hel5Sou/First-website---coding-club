###  Task 1: Create and set up your profile.html page
- Create a new HTML document named profile.html
- Set it up with an appropriate title such as "Profile - Jane Smith". 
- At the top of the body element, add the h1 element with Profile - (your name) as its text content. 
- Beneath the h1 element, create two section elements.
 
### Task 2: Fill in your profile
- In the first section element, first add your profile photo using the img element. Don't forget to add a descriptive alt text.
- Beneath it, add an h2 element with the text content "About Me".
- Beneath it, add an unordered list. In separate listitems, provide this information:
- - Where were you born?
- - Where do you live now?
- Provide at least 2 or more information about you
- In the second <section> element, add another h2 element with the text content "Interests".
- Beneath this, create another unordered list to list some of your interests and hobbies. 
 
### Task 3: Add an audio element
- This is where you will use the MP3 file that you downloaded and added to an mp3s folder. 
- Add an audio element on your webpage where you deem appropriate.
- The audio element works almost exactly like the video element.
- It supports MP3, OGG, and WAV file formats.
- Give it a src attribute with a relative path to your mp3 file.
- Also give it a Boolean attribute of controls. You can add loop to it as well, if you wish. 
- - inside the start and end tags, add this text content, replacing where it says YourAudioFileNameHere with your actual audio file's name:
- - Your browser does not support HTML5 audio. Here is a href="mp3s/YourAudioFileNameHere.mp3"a link to the audio /a instead.
 
### Task 4: Enhance your profile
- Use your judgment to place your other image file(s) in an appropriate place or places within your document. It or they might belong in the first section, the second section, or even a new section.
- Use the a element to add at least two hyperlinks of your choice. These can be in the form of links to other webpages, a link to another section of the same page, or a link to your phone or email. Two is the minimum; you can add as many as you wish!
- Add em and/or strong elements if appropriate. Use your discretion. If there is not any content that would require these elements, you don't need to add them.
- You can add more content to your profile, or try using your profile page to play with a new element that you haven't used yet. 
 
### Test
- Open the page you created in your browser with Live Server. 
- Verify that your images and text all load correctly.
- Verify that all links are functioning.
- Verify that the embedded audio player is functioning.
